Subject: [PATCH] Remove `signals` from find_package(Boost COMPONENTS ...).

tf2 is using signals2, which is not the same library.
Additionally, signals2 has always been header only, and header only
libraries must not be listed in find_package.

Boost 1.69 removed the old signals library entirely, so the otherwise
useless `COMPONENTS signals` actually breaks the build.
